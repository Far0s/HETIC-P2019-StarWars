# HETIC-P2019-StarWars

## The project

From Monday 14th of December to Friday 18th, our goal is to create a website with a truly simple but vast theme : **STAR WARS**.
We chose to do a humorisitc character creator based on the famous astromech **R2-D2**, allowing to customize the tenacious little droid, and many more !

## The team

- Pierre DE GOURCY
- Margaux TELLIER
- Thaddé MENEUR
- Sébastien DANCER-MICHEL
- Mathieu MERCIER

## Features
- The website is a droid customizer. 
- The user begins by choosing the form of his astromech's head, and his color scheme. The designs features many droids seen in the films and the TV series. He also has the possibility to create a totally random astromech.
- After that he can change his droid's name and preview his little companion.
- On the right the user will have more options to customize his droid: hats, bags and other accessories, and backgrounds !
- Finally, a "share" button will be available with multiple options: social media, export/download, etc...
- While customizing him, the astromech will react and emit sounds, revealing if he likes the style you're giving him !
