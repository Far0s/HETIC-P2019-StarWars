# HETIC-P2019-StarWars

## The project

From Monday 14th of December to Friday 18th, our goal is to create a website with a truly simple but vast theme : **STAR WARS**.
We chose to do a humorisitc character creator based on the famous astromech **R2-D2**, allowing to customize the tenacious little droid, and many more !
